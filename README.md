This was my final individual project that was built for a showcase for the Gainesville Dev Academy.

The idea was to create a website that advocated for bicycle safety. I attended a JavaScript meetup and a presenter used Materialize for CSS. I used this for the first-time. 
Additionally, I used mongodb, AngularJS and nodejs for the front and back-end of this website.
